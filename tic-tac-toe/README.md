# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Followed lecture contents to build a _Tic Tac Toe_ game.  
Used `reducer` and React Hooks (Functional Component) to build application.

**Feature List (From Lecture)**
- use `reducer` instead of `state`.
- 2P Tic-Tac-Toe game logic
  - Alternate turn after one person place a stone.
  - Prevent click for the cell where somebody already placed the stone.
- Algorithm to determine winner.
- Performance optimization

**What I added/modified**
- 1P and 2P mode
  - Computer player's algorithm to choose best possible option (1P Hard Mode)
    - `<Illustrate algorithm here>`
  - Computer player's algorithm to choose random option (1P Easy Mode)
- Performance optimization
- Design for both mobile and desktop site.
