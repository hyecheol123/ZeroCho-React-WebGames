# Response Time (반응시간) Game

Followed lecture contents to build a simple game to measure user's response time.  
Used React Hooks to build application.

**Feature List (From Lecture)**
- Measure response time using `setTimeout()`

**What I added/modified**
- Alert Modal
- Desktop/Mobile Design
- Performance Optimization
  - Split Components
  - Use `React.useMemo()` and `React.useCallback()`.
